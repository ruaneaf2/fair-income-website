            <p>3 million people - including around 761,0000 children - are now living in poverty in Australia. The current income support levels are forcing many to make tough daily choices between food, rent, and healthcare. 70% of individuals on income support payments said that they are rationing meals and eating less, to compensate for other essential expenses.</p>
            <p>This financial stress is directly impacting individuals' physical and mental health. 96% of people on income support payments reported that they are suffering poor mental and physical health because they are not able to meet their basic needs. Many are delaying essential medical care purely because they are unable to afford it, a decision no one should have to make.</p>
            <p>1 in 6 (17%) of Australian children live in poverty. Parents are unable to meet the needs of their children, with low income support hindering their potential from the very beginning. This financial restriction is creating barriers that affect every aspect of a child's life - including nutrition, healthcare, education, and opportunities for growth and healthy development.</p>
