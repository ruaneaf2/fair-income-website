            <h2>Story 1</h2>
            <p>I have been living off jobseeker for over 5 years now. At the age of 50 I went through a difficult divorce, leaving me with nothing. Each week it is a struggle to get food onto the table, with the rising rent payments. But it’s not just about not having enough for the basic necessities, it’s the mental strain that comes along with it. Looking back on the last 5 years, I couldn’t tell you one day I wasn’t stressed or riddled with anxiety about my upcoming rent payments, how I could afford going to the doctors if I could survive another winter without heating. There is a misconception that just because jobseeker allows me to live in a house and not be sleeping on the streets then it “must be enough”. It’s far from it. Each day I feel like I’m drowning, and what angers me the most is there is a solution for this – which is why we need the support of the people as the government just aren’t listening to us.”</p>

            <h2>Story 2</h2>
            <p>I feel sick knowing our government would rather starve people to punish them for being unemployed than spend what is ultimately a small amount of money…and sacrifice the weak and the sick. It’s made it clear to me who the people in power care about, and what is clearest is they do not care about people like me..</p>

            <h2>Story 3</h2>
            <p>"I've been on disability support for two years. It's tough. After getting sick at 45, I lost my job and now every day is a struggle. The money I get just covers the basics like food and rent, but if anything unexpected happens, I'm stuck. It's not just about being short on cash; it's the constant worry that wears me down. Sometimes I have to choose between medicine and heating. It feels like nobody sees how hard this is.</p>
