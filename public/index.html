        <h2>Access to Adequate Social Security</h2>
        <p>This is meant to ensure equitable access to healthcare, housing, food, and education. However, the reality for the 5 million Australians receiving income support starkly contrasts these expectations.</p>
        <p>Income support, designed as a safety net, is proving too low to adequately cover the basic costs of living. This gap between what is being provided and what is actually needed is forcing a significant proportion of our community, many of whom include vulnerable people, into a cycle of financial stress and uncertainty.</p>

        <h1>Poverty is a political choice</h1>
        <p>It is the responsibility of the government to ensure the welfare of all citizens, and by failing to provide adequate income support, they neglect this. While tax cuts for high-income earners (most of which are men) are being introduced, those most in need are being left behind, exacerbating income inequality and widening the gap between the rich and the poor.</p>
        <p>Lifting the income to at least $78 a day will cost less than half the cost of the $254 billion stage-three-tax cuts, which the government is adamant on implementing. Rates should be equitable, based on the actual costs of living.</p>
        <h2>We have the means to ensure this doesn’t happen. Now we just need the political will.</h2>
        <p>Join us in advocating for change. Together, we can make a difference for those in need and build a stronger community for all.</p>
